Virtual Framebuffer Device Driver

Used for creating nonpaged contigous memory buffer and make
userspace program to access this one, request physical, logical
and userspace address of this buffer.

Userspace address is used to direct access to this buffer from
user-mode application (in my case to store rendered or trascoded
video frame).

Physical address is used to submitting to VideoOuput device DMA
controller, to make fast transfer framebuffer data from system 
memory into hardware PCI device allocated framebuffer.

First version is poor-drafted. static 4MB buffer should be allocated.
